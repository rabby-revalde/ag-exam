This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First,

-  Clone the repo,
-  run the development server, see below for options.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Design

-  extract Images/Background from FIGMA.
-  use TailwindCss for faster and better coding experience.
-  use CSS Modules for my custom styles.
-  decide/add what components/section to make and is it reusable.
-  start local machine setup

#### Challenges

-  I'm not used on Load More features with pre-existing next data after load-more button is clicked, but then I found a solution online which to use the gradient white opacity background and modified the default visible boxes.
